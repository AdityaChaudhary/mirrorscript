# mirrorScript
Script to change kali repository mirror

http://http.kali.org redirects you to the closest available mirror based on your physical location.
Most of the time the servers may experience heavy load, thus slowing down upgrades even with fast connection.
This script lets you rank and choose alternative mirrors and override it.

# Requirements
Kali Linux,
Python2.7 (comes pre-bundled)

# Usage
Run the script in privilege mode, such that sources.list could be edited
